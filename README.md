# Minimap

MiniMap is an autonomous UAV reconnaissance system designed to be placed in the hands of first responders around the world. Housed in a portable canister tube, MiniMap aims to provide a seamless way to survey a fire, crash site, or other emergency safely to gain critical initial information within minutes of notice. First responders simply use a personal device to circle an area on a map, place the MiniMap matrix, and a tube-launched swarm of drones will begin to survey an area of up to a few square miles.

This repository contains the front-end UI for the application, back-end drone communication software, and path planning algorithms.
